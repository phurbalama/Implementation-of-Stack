# Implementation-of-Stack

using java programming language, I implemented stacks by creating function pop and push. I used array of string to take input during push and then convert string to int during pop so that I can do operating for the stacks.

I implemented stack to do addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and exponential. 

#Palindrome
Using implementation of stack, the program checks whether the string is palindrome or not.
